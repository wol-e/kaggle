# Doing some classificatin excercises on categorical data

Late submissions for kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/cat-in-the-dat/overview

My best score is 0.79897 with a logistic regression after one hot encoding. See `regressions` notebook. WIth some fine tuning I could probably get closer to the top score on kaggel which is 0.80283. But the leaderboard on top is so close that I don't even want to try to squaaze in anywere there :D
